# food-101-classification
Train a light, medium and heavy image classification model for Food-101 dataset.

## Light Model

Fine tuning the MobileNet-v2 model for the food dataset using Tensorflow 2.0

## Medium Model

Used ResNet-50 model backbone to train food classifier on PyTorch

## Heavy Model

Trained on InceptionResNet-v2 backbone to train a heavy classifier with a larger number of parameters. Trained using TF 2.0 with defined tf.data pipeline
